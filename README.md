UI-Styler: Ultrasound Image Style Transfer with Class-Aware Prompts for Cross-Device Diagnosis Using a Frozen Black-Box Inference Network

---

## üß™ Abstract

Ultrasound images vary across devices, causing domain shifts that reduce the reliability of fixed black-box inference models. Unpaired image translation (UIT) methods can alleviate this, but most neglect class-specific alignment, leading to misaligned content-class mappings and reduced diagnostic accuracy. We propose UI-Styler, a **class-aware style transfer** framework for ultrasound. It employs a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer target-domain textures while preserving source structures, and a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels to ensure semantic consistency. Experiments on cross-device tasks show that UI-Styler surpasses existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both distribution alignment and downstream tasks like classification and segmentation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate uistyler
```

> Requires Python ‚â• 3.8 and a CUDA-enabled GPU for training.

## üìö Dataset

Please follow the instructions in [DATASET.md](https://github.com/nycu-acm/UIStyler/tree/main/dataset/DATASET.md) to download and preprocess the four domains (**BUSBRA**, **BUSI**, **UCLM**, **UDIAT**) into the unified structure (`full/`, `train/`, `valid/` with `imgs/` and `masks/`).

## üèãÔ∏è Training

1. Download the [pretrained perceptual weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BinnwM5AmIcVubr16tPTqxMjUCE8iu5M/view).
2. Train (ensure `--source` ‚â† `--target`):
   
   ```bash
   python train.py --source BUSBRA --target BUSI --device cuda:0
   # source and target ‚àà {BUSBRA, BUSI, UCLM, UDIAT}
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ Evaluation

```bash
# KID
python downstream/KID.py --source BUSBRA --target BUSI --gpu 0

# Classification (ViT-B/16)
python downstream/classification/test.py --source BUSBRA --target BUSI --device cuda:0

# Segmentation (SAMUS)
python downstream/segmentation/test_all.py --source_name BUSBRA --task BUSI
```
